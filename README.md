Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a system into smaller, self-contained modules, each handling a specific aspect of functionality. These modules interact through well-defined interfaces, allowing for easier development, testing, and maintenance.

Modularity enhances maintainability by isolating changes, simplifying debugging, and enabling easier testing of individual components. It improves scalability by facilitating parallel development, promoting component reusability, and allowing for seamless system expansion without disrupting the overall architecture.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit Testing:
Involves testing individual components or units of the software in isolation to ensure they function correctly.
It's often automated, focusing on verifying the behavior of small code segments.

Integration Testing:
Validates the interaction and interoperability between different modules or components.
Ensures that integrated units work seamlessly together within the system.

System Testing:
Tests the complete, integrated system to verify that it meets specified requirements.
It assesses the system's functionality, performance, reliability, and other quality attributes.

Acceptance Testing:
Determines whether the software meets customer requirements and is ready for deployment.
It's usually performed by users or stakeholders to validate the software against their expectations.
Importance of Testing in Software Development
